Pontis Weather was developed in 2019 for use by Pontis Nicaragua (www.pontisnicaragua.org) on remote farms in rural Nicaragua.  The challenge was to both record weather data for use in analyzing micro climates while providing real-time irrigation requirements data to the farmers.

The farm locations demanded that the unit be autonomous, solar powered, provide data on usb thumb drives, be operated by both untrained farmers and semi-trained technicians, and survice the very wet, humid, and tough environment.

For the best background, recommend going through the provided manual.
